====

## To Submit this Assignment
  * fork this repository and work in a branch called `lab-10`
  * Set up Travis CI on your forked repo
  * submit a pull request to your forked repository
  * submit a link to your PR in canvas
  * write a question and observation on canvas

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
  <!-- list of files, configurations, tools, etc that are required -->
  Your lab directory must include  
  * **src/ directory** *
     * **lib/** -- directory for holding your programs helper modules
     * **__test/__** -- directory for holding your programs unit and integration tests
  * **index.js** -- The entry point to your module
  * **README.md** -- with a documentation about your lab
  * **.gitignore** -- with a robust .gitignore
  * **.eslintrc.json** -- with the class .eslintrc file
  * **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
  * **.package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies

#### Testing  
  * write at least three two assertions for each method of the Stack and Queue List Data Structures
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

####  Documentation  
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

#### Feature Tasks  
  * implement a Stack constructor
    * implement `push(value)`, `pop()`, and `peek()` methods on the Stack class by utilizing methods from the Linked List class you already defined in Lab 10 or in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repo. 
  * implement a Queue constructor
    * implement `enqueue(value)` and `dequeue()` methods on the Queue class by utilizing methods from the Linked List class you already defined in Lab 10 or in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repo. 
  * Label the Big Oh time and space complexity of your methods in comments
  * **If you do not have a completed Linked List class to utilize, you may use Javascript arrays like the lecture code, *but you will only receive a maximum of 8 points.***
